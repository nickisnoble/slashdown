//  Welcome to slashdown!
//  A superset of markdown for quickly creating web pages.
//  Plays *very* well with: HTMX, Tailwind, AlpineJS, and the backend of your choice.

// This is a comment. It will not be rendered in the output.

/main .container.mx-auto
  // Any line starting with a / is a tag, unless it's a comment.
  // You can add classes and ids to tags via the usual shorthands (e.g. .class #id)
  // You can also add attributes the normal way! (e.g. href="https://example.com" )

  // Anything not starting with a / is a child of the previous tag, and will be rendered as markdown
  // Indentation is important! It determines the parent/child relationship of tags.

  # This is a heading. It will be rendered as an h1 tag.

  It's the child of the section element above it.

  ```ruby
  # You can write code blocks too, here's some ruby!
  def greet(name)
    puts "Hello, #{name}!"
  end
  ```

  ```ts
  // And another! (Both of these should have accurate syntax highlighting)
  export function greet(name: string) {
    return `Hello, ${name}!`;
  }
  ```


  // An empty tag will be rendered as a <div> tag.
  // And items on the immediate next line after a tag, if indented, will be parsed as attributes.
  / .grid.grid-col-2
    data-foo="bar"

    This will render as a paragraph.

    And this will render as a paragraph too.

    // Boolean attributes are supported too!
    /input#name type="text" placeholder="Enter your name" autofocus

  // Items at the same indent level become siblings.
  /footer#site-footer .flex.justify-between
    Made with ❤️ by slashdown.

    // Plaintext can be easily added with " = " at the end of a tag
